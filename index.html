        <p> Hi! My name is Dawson Peddie, im 21 years old and im an IMD student! I look forward to expanding my knowledge and skillset throughout this semester! Im not sure what I would like to do or specialize in when I complete this program but currently im leaning towards the video side of things, however, I also really like design and graphic design im just not very great at it. I hope to develop even more connections and create lasting bonds/friendships as well, I like to think im a people person but, I do struggle sometimes so I would like to socialize and just do more in general.  </p>
